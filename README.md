# gmbc-colonocytes
Metagenomic analysis of Global Microbiome Conservancy samples and RNA-sequencing analysis of treated human colonic epithelial cells.
Overview of Rmd notebooks:

**01_metaG-profiling**\
Initial processing of metagenomic shotgun sequences.\
<br>

**02_metaG-taxoanalysis**\
Exploratory analysis of metagenomic reads: QC metrics, differential abundance analysis, and visualization of taxonomic composition. Includes steps to filter low abundance taxa and perform transformations.\
*Relevant for Figure 1B, Figure 1C, Figure S1C, Figure S1D, and Figure S2*.\
<br>

**03_RNAseq-processing**\
Initial processing of host RNA sequencing reads and exploratory analysis. Includes minimal filtering.\
*Relevant for Figure S1A and Figure S1B*.\
<br>

**04_RNAseq-urbanism**\
Includes steps to perform differential expression analysis of host colonocytes in response to urbanism. \
*Relevant for Figure 2A-C, Figure S3 and Figure S4*.\
